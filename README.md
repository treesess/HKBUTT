# HKBUTT
In Hong Kong Cap. 371 Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance once might have protected people from second-hand smoke. But I seriously doubt that it is a zombie law now since the cigarette butts are everywhere in non-smoking areas. I complained for years but in vain. Finally came this project HKBUTT. The butt of Hong Kong.
