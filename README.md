# HKBUTT

In Hong Kong Cap. 371 Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance once might have protected people from second-hand smoke. But I seriously doubt that it is a zombie law now since the cigarette butts are everywhere in non-smoking areas. I complained for years but in vain. Finally came this project HKBUTT. The butt of Hong Kong. 

## 1. Some background info

I have been living in Hong Kong since 2015. I worked on campus for more than 7 years. I lived in dirty Sham Shui Po district for about the same duration. Everywhere, people smoke. it's very hard to avoid second-hand smoke every day for me. 

I complained to the authorities and any relevant organizations. My anger was and is still triggered by smokers time by time again and over. I have some irrational conflicts with smokers on the street and on campus. The smoking situation in Hong Kong is something I have nowhere to escape. I was pushed to actions of all kinds. So far nothing worked. NOTHING, WORKED. 

Yes, not everyone would be like me being so triggered by the smokers. I have my own traumatic experiences about smoking which made me who I am. It made me inevitably engaged in a war with those smokers who triggered my deep resentment against the smoke and severe physical reactions as well. Don't tell me to calm down facing those offensive smokers who care nothing about other non-smokers' feelings. I have grown old enough to understand what a war is. They or me, one of us will surrender or die in this war. 

### 1.1 Smokers in non-smoking areas - Staircases

This is where I got frequent offences where I lived. I am not rich and lived in a 40-plus-year-old building in SSP. I moved once only because the neighbourhood smoked too hard and suffocated me. In the staircases of those old buildings, cigarette butts are everywhere. I complained many times to the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office, Department of Health.

All in vain. No substantial improvement.

With all the butts in the staircase, they simply told me they found no one smoking. Not just ones. All the complaints received the same kind of reply.

### 1.2 Smokers in non-smoking areas - Campus

This is where I got frequent offences where I worked. I can be very clear to say, THEi Tsing Yi Campus and IVE Tsing Yi Campus. Of course, I complained, many times, verbally, officially. Of course, nothing worked. 

Allow me to jump part of the stories here because they are lengthy. The situation is almost the same as where I lived. people smoked. Much more often than you can imagine. I can tell you this because of this HKBUTT project is making progress in confirming this statement. 

## 2. Project HKBUTT 

### 2.1 Last straw

Right before this project, there was one case that made me rage after a day of hard work and offended by smokers. I was on the edge of breaking out and instinctively put out my phone starting to shoot a video confronting the three smokers. My anger pushed me to send a formal email to the Campus Management telling them that I had made my decision to keep taking videos when being offended again, also starting a public spreadsheet recording every case of smoking on campus. 

The Institute paid attention to this report and complaint email. But after all, all they can do is sending emails to students and staff to emphasize that this is a non-smoking campus etc. etc. I appreciate that. However, the smokers are still offending me without a stop. 

### 2.2 No one is coming

No one is coming. I have to do it by myself because I have tried all other ways to reach for help. 

But how. I cannot sue the smokers. Neither the campus can. I don't know what can they actually do. They told me to find security guards for help if being offended. Honestly, that is impossible at all. I can show you why I say so. 

So my situation is, I cannot even take video because it might have privacy issues. lol. I have no CCTV access. The only shreds of evidence I can get are cigarette butts on the ground. Oh yeah, those smokers, smoked in non-smoking areas, and then littered the butts. In Hong Kong, littering means fixed penalty of HKD1,500 same as smoking. 

Yes, so HKBUTT started with butts. There is no other way. Can you feel my desperation?

### 2.3 Collection of evidence

As a technician, I have manufacturing abilities. I thought about how to collect the evidence properly. The butts on the ground are hazardous, dangerous, and harmful to health. I need to collect them and be able to present them with credentials. So here is the plan: 

- PMMA transparent case with PMMA double-side tape and 502 strong glue to fix the butts in a sealed container.
- GPS, photos, spreadsheet, WhatsApp message record, all those I can think of, to record the details of evidence collecting manner.
- Engraving unique numbering to each PMMA case in order to guarantee the authenticity of evidence collection.
- Building up SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) to make sure the collection can be executed smoothly.
- Starting to prepare Q&A for any possible questioning of my project.

I have done this for a while. 

This project is still ongoing with a fast increase of butts collected and sealed in PMMA cases. 

### 2.4 Tech details

How to ensure the authenticity of evidence collected. 

I bought PMMA cases online (of course all from my own pocket). Currently using those two kinds:

- The small one numbered started with HKBUTT00001.
- The larger one numbered started with HKBUTTPLUS00001.

I modified my own machine (a VORON0.2 with a drilling toolhead, aka fdm6) to engrave the numberings on the **inner surface(s)** of the PMMA cases. Then cover up with PMMA double-side tape for the fixing of butts picked up and placed into the cases. By doing this, each case is unique. With the GPS info and a bunch of photos taken during the collection operation, I believe it is trustworthy enough. 

Tell me if I can do anything to improve. 

### 2.5 How to present

This part is the actual hardest. I've got thoughts and plans. And dreams. Not yet ready to say.
