Due to the conflict that happened tonight (21 May 2024), I have to take some actions in case I get hit. 

- I scheduled the publicity of the raw video which recorded the whole incident on both YouTube and Bilibili. Anyone can find the video available at 12:00 on 23 May 2024 as scheduled.
- I wrote an email to the campus authority, and reported the incident with the video uploaded to internal OneDrive Business available to all VTC staff.
- I will report to the Hong Kong Police after gathering all the data of this project HKBUTT with backup in my rented residence in SSP.

All butts collected sealed in PMMA are stored in room BU02C, IVE Tsing Yi, TY, NT, HK. 

It is not in the plan but here are they:

- The upper part cases were engraved with the numbering as HKBUTTPLUSxxxxx. They are large PMMA cases containing around ten or even more butts in one case.
- The lower part cases were engraved with the numbering as HKBUTTxxxxx. They are the starter small PMMA cases.
