- Prepare a paper handtowel for hygiene purposes of butt collection on a flat surface (e.g., ground, flat bench, etc).
- Collect the butt(s) by carefully pressing the case with double-side PMMA tape prepared to the butt(s) to make the butt(s) stuck to the case without touching the butt(s). 
Take a photo with the butt(s) stuck in the case.

- Use the PMMA superglue to seal the four edges of the PMMA evidence case up carefully. 
- In case the glue flows out and spills on the paper handtowel, move quickly to avoid the paper handtowel sticking where it is.

- After the glue dries up and the case is fully sealed, take photos clearly showing the numbering of the sealed evidence case, on both sides.

## 6 Evidence storage

- Examine the evidence cases containing the butts to check if there is any leakage or damage of the cases from time to time.
- Use 75% alcohol spray to clean the evidence cases from time to time to avoid pollution.
